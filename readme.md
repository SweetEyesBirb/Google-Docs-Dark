# Description

This is a browser extension able to toggle dark mode on both Google Docs and Google Sheets, or on any other https://docs.google.com/ domain.  

> Unlike other extensions, this extension is able to target the work sheet, the entire page, or both. This allows for a full dark mode with more flexibility.  
> It's intended to work even when 'auto dark mode' is enebled in Chrome.  

> The ability of toggling only the working sheet could be particularly useful if the document contains images. These cannot be targeted via CSS selectors as they come from Google's API. As a result, the image colors will be inverted. However, page color inversion can be momentarily toggled to check the image's true colors.
